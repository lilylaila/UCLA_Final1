    DOMAIN

The problem is drawn from a data set on abalone from Tasmania and Australia in 1995.

    PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given attribute data on 4,177 abalone, we will use supervised learning to develop a regression model that can predict the relationship between abalone age (through rings data) given various descriptive attributes of the abalone. 

We will examine a number of factors that relate to abalone age including length, weights of whole abalone and parts of shucked abalone. 

    DATASET AND INPUTS

The dataset to be examined is abalone data which consists of 4,177 rows of data and 9 variables (sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, rings). 

    SOLUTION STATEMENT

A solution to this problem will be a regression model such as a linear or logistic regression.

    BENCHMARK MODEL

Given that we seek a regression model a good naive benchmark would be to use either the mean or the median of the rings for the dataset.

    EVALUATION METRICS

Given that this is a regression task, we can measure the success of our model using the R^2 metric, the Mean Absolute Error, or the Mean Squared Error.
